## Intro

Machine learning example in Rust and Polars. This repo is supposed to apply Custom decision tree and later other ML algorithms to (example) Titanic dataset imported with Polars dataframe. There are also examples of scaling, one hot encoding and other common preprocessing for ML appled to Polars dataframe.


## todo:

models:
- logistic regression
- decision tree
